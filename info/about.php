	Quran Analysis (QA) is an endeavor to make a full Semantic Search and Intelligence System for the Quran

<p class='info-page-text'>

	Through QA, Users and Scholars can search the Quran by "meaning" using both Arabic and English language,
	explore the results through state-of-art visualization techniques,
	acquire detailed statistics and
	find hidden patterns and relations
