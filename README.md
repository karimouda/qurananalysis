# Introduction

Quran Analysis (QA); a Semantic Search, Exploration, Analysis and Question Answering System for the Quran. QA is also an opensource framework and an online website (www.qurananalysis.com) for Muslims and Non-Muslims to search and explore the Quran in a smart-semantic manner. The system offers linguistic and computational researchers 20 tools and multiple resources to facilitate their daily research tasks. One of the resources offered is QA Ontology which is a comprehensive Ontology for the Quran.

QA started as an MSc project at the University of Leeds in 2015 supervised by Eric Atwell. The project aimed to glu-together and build on previous research done in the university and to provide an opensource base for Quran Analysis work, paving the way for innovation in this area.

This project started as an Msc project at the University of Leeds in 2015, more information in the Thesis below

[QuranAnalysis: A Semantic Search and Intelligence System for the Quran](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282648776_QuranAnalysis_A_Semantic_Search_and_Intelligence_System_for_the_Quran)

The WIKI includes more details and tutorials giving examples of how QA can be used and extended

The code is not well commented due to time limitations during the MSc

## How can you benefit from QA ?
